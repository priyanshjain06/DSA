# 🎒 Unbounded Knapsack Problem

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array **wt** and **val** respectively. Also, a knapsack with a weight limit **capacity**. The task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit. 

**Note:** Each item can be taken any number of times.

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: val = [1, 1], wt = [2, 1], capacity = 3
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:** The optimal choice is to pick the 2nd element 3 times.

### Example 2

```
Input: val[] = [6, 1, 7, 7], wt[] = [1, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 8
Output: 48
```

**Explanation:** The optimal choice is to pick the 1st element 8 times.

### Example 3

```
Input: val[] = [6, 8, 7, 100], wt[] = [2, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 1
Output: 0
```

**Explanation:** We can't pick any element. Hence, total profit is 0.

## ⚠️ Constraints

- `1 <= val.size() = wt.size() <= 1000`
- `1 <= capacity <= 1000`
- `1 <= val[i], wt[i] <= 100`
