# 🏠 House Robber Problem

## 📋 Problem Statement
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses have connected security systems that will **automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the **maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police**.

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3).
Total: 1 + 3 = 4
```

### Example 2  
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), house 3 (money = 9), and house 5 (money = 1).
Total: 2 + 9 + 1 = 12
```
