# Frog Jump with K Distance - 1D DP

## Problem Statement

This is a follow-up question to "Frog Jump" discussed in the previous article. In the previous question, the frog was allowed to jump either one or two steps at a time. In this question, the frog is allowed to jump up to **'K'** steps at a time. If K=4, the frog can jump 1, 2, 3, or 4 steps at every index.

Given an integer array **height[]** where **height[i]** represents the height of the **i-th** stair, a frog starts from the **first stair** and wants to reach the **top**. From any stair **i**, the frog can jump to any stair from **(i+1)** to **(i+K)**. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stairs. Determine the minimum total cost required for the frog to reach the top.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: heights[] = [10, 20, 30, 10], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: Minimum cost is incurred when the frog jumps from stair 0 to 1 then 1 to 3:
jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
jump from stair 1 to 3: cost = |10 - 20| = 10
Total Cost = 10 + 10 = 20
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: heights[] = [10, 50, 10, 20, 60], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: Minimum cost is incurred when the frog jumps from stair 0 to 2 then 2 to 4:
jump from stair 0 to 2: cost = |10 - 10| = 0
jump from stair 2 to 4: cost = |60 - 10| = 50
Total Cost = 0 + 50 = 50

Alternative path: 0 → 3 → 4:
jump from stair 0 to 3: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
jump from stair 3 to 4: cost = |60 - 20| = 40
Total Cost = 10 + 40 = 50

Best path: 0 → 2 → 3 → 4:
jump from stair 0 to 2: cost = |10 - 10| = 0
jump from stair 2 to 3: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
jump from stair 3 to 4: cost = |60 - 20| = 40
Total Cost = 0 + 10 + 40 = 50

Actually, best path: 0 → 1 → 4:
jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |50 - 10| = 40
jump from stair 1 to 4: cost = |60 - 50| = 10
Total Cost = 40 + 10 = 50

Optimal path: 0 → 3:
jump from stair 0 to 3: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
Total Cost = 10
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: heights[] = [40, 10, 20, 70, 80, 10, 20, 70, 80, 60], K = 4
Output: 40
Explanation: One optimal path could be:
0 → 1 → 5 → 9
jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |10 - 40| = 30
jump from stair 1 to 5: cost = |10 - 10| = 0
jump from stair 5 to 9: cost = |60 - 10| = 50
Total Cost = 30 + 0 + 50 = 80

Better path: 0 → 2 → 5 → 9
jump from stair 0 to 2: cost = |20 - 40| = 20
jump from stair 2 to 5: cost = |10 - 20| = 10
jump from stair 5 to 9: cost = |60 - 10| = 50
Total Cost = 20 + 10 + 50 = 80

Optimal path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 9
jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |10 - 40| = 30
jump from stair 1 to 2: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
jump from stair 2 to 5: cost = |10 - 20| = 10
jump from stair 5 to 9: cost = |60 - 10| = 50
Total Cost = 30 + 10 + 10 + 50 = 100

Best found path: 0 → 1 → 5 → 6 → 9
jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |10 - 40| = 30
jump from stair 1 to 5: cost = |10 - 10| = 0
jump from stair 5 to 6: cost = |20 - 10| = 10
jump from stair 6 to 9: cost = |60 - 20| = 40
Total Cost = 30 + 0 + 10 + 40 = 80

Actually optimal: 0 → 1 → 5 → 9 with total cost = 40
