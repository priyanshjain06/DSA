# Subset Sum Problem

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers **arr[]** and a value **sum**, determine if there is a subset of **arr[]** with sum equal to given **sum**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], sum = 9
Output: true
```

**Explanation:** Here there exists a subset with target sum = 9, 4+3+2 = 9.

### Example 2

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], sum = 30
Output: false
```

**Explanation:** There is no subset with target sum 30.

### Example 3

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], sum = 6
Output: true
```

**Explanation:** The entire array can be taken as a subset, giving 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

## Constraints

```
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
0 <= K <= 10^3
```
