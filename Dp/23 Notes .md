# ðŸŽ¯ Target Sum Formula Comparison

## ðŸ”´ LeetCode Assumes:

```
sum(P) - sum(N) = target
```

where **P** means all positive numbers and **N** means all negative numbers

```
sum(P) = (target + sum(N)) â†’ which is (totalSum + target) / 2
```

### âœ… Final Formula in LeetCode:

```
subsetSum = (totalSum + target) / 2
```
