# All Distinct Longest Common Subsequences

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings **s1** and **s2**. Your task is to print all **distinct** longest common subsequences in lexicographical order.

**Note:** A subsequence is derived from another string by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s1 = "abaaa", s2 = "baabaca"
Output: ["aaaa", "abaa", "baaa"]
Explanation: Length of lcs is 4, in lexicographical order they are "aaaa", "abaa", "baaa".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s1 = "aaa", s2 = "a"
Output: ["a"]
Explanation: Length of lcs is 1 and it is "a".
```

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 50`
