    # Max Sum without Adjacents

Given an array **arr** containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum of any possible subsequence such that no two numbers in the subsequence should be adjacent in array **arr**.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5]
Output: 110
Explanation: If you take indices 0, 3 and 5, then = 5+100+5 = 110.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 7, 10]
Output: 13
Explanation: 3 and 10 forms a non continuous subsequence with maximum sum.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: arr[] = [9, 1, 6, 10]
Output: 19
Explanation: 9 and 10 forms a non continuous subsequence with maximum sum.
```
