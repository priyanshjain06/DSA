# 🧩 Longest Nice Subarray Problem ✨

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

A subarray of `nums` is called **nice** if the bitwise **AND** of every pair of elements in **different** positions within the subarray equals `0`.

Return the length of the **longest** nice subarray.

> **Note:** A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.  
> Subarrays of length `1` are always considered nice.

## 🌟 Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,8,48,10]
Output: 3
```

#### Explanation:

The longest nice subarray is [3,8,48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions:

- 3 AND 8 = 0
- 3 AND 48 = 0
- 8 AND 48 = 0

It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3.

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,11,13]
Output: 1
```

#### Explanation:

The length of the longest nice subarray is 1. Any subarray of length 1 can be chosen.
