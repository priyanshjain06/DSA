## Flood Fill Algorithm

Given an m x n image grid, perform a flood fill starting from (sr, sc). Change all connected pixels of the same color to the new color.

### Steps:

1. If the starting pixel already has the target color, return the image (to avoid an infinite loop).
2. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to change the pixel and recursively update its 4-directionally connected neighbors.
3. Stop when no more connected pixels of the original color exist.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input:
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

Output:
[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation: All connected 1s change to 2.

Example 2:

cpp
Input:
image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

Output:
[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Explanation: No change since the color is already 0.
