## Rotten Oranges Problem

Given a matrix where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:

- 0: Empty cell
- 1: Cells have fresh oranges
- 2: Cells have rotten oranges

We have to determine what is the earliest time after which all the oranges are rotten. A rotten orange at index [i, j] can rot other fresh oranges at indexes [i-1, j], [i+1, j], [i, j-1], [i, j+1] (up, down, left, and right) in unit time.

**Note**: Your task is to return the minimum time to rot all the fresh oranges. If not possible, return -1.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```plaintext
mat[][] =
[[0, 1, 2],
 [0, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 1]]
```

Output:
1
Explanation: Oranges at positions (0,2), (1,2), and (2,0) will rot oranges at (0,1), (1,1), (2,2) and (2,1) in unit time.

Example 2:
Input:
mat[][] = [[2, 2, 0, 1]]
Output:
-1
Explanation: Oranges at (0,0) and (0,1) can't rot the orange at (0,3).

Example 3:
Input:
mat[][] =
[[2, 2, 2], 
 [0, 2, 0]]
Output:
2
Explanation: There is no fresh orange.
