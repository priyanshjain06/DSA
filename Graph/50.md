# Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

## Problem Description

Given `n` stones placed on a 2D plane at integer coordinates, we can remove a stone if it shares the same row or column with another remaining stone. Find the maximum number of stones that can be removed.

## Key Insight

The maximum number of stones we can remove equals: **Total stones - Number of connected components**

Each connected component will have exactly one stone remaining at the end.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5

Visualization:
  0 1 2
0 X X .
1 X . X  
2 . X X

Connected components: 1 (all stones are connected)
Removable stones: 6 - 1 = 5
```

### Example 2
```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3

Visualization:
  0 1 2
0 X . X
1 . X .
2 X . X

Connected components: 2
- Component 1: [0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2,2]
- Component 2: [1,1]
Removable stones: 5 - 2 = 3
```
