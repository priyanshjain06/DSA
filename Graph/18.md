## Cycle Detection in Directed Graph

### Problem Statement

Given a Directed Graph with `V` vertices (Numbered from `0` to `V-1`) and `E` edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where `adj[i]` contains a list of vertices that are directly reachable from vertex `i`. Specifically, `adj[i][j]` represents an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: adj = [[1, 2], [2], [0, 3], [3]]
Output: 1 (True)
Explanation: 3 -> 3 is a cycle.

Example 2:
Input: adj = [[1], [2], [3], []]
Output: 0 (False)
Explanation: No cycle in the graph.
```
