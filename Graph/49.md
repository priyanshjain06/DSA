# Number of Islands II - Dynamic Island Formation

## Problem Description

Given an `n Ã— m` matrix initially filled with water (0s), we need to perform `k` operations where each operation converts a water cell to land (1). After each operation, we need to count the number of islands.

An **island** is a group of connected land cells (1s) that share a common side (4-directional connectivity).

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 4, m = 5, k = 4
Operations: [[1,1], [0,1], [3,3], [3,4]]

Step-by-step visualization:
Initial:  00000    After op 1:  00000    After op 2:  01000
          00000                 01000                 01000  
          00000                 00000                 00000
          00000                 00000                 00000
          Islands: 0            Islands: 1           Islands: 1

After op 3:  01000    After op 4:  01000
             01000                 01000
             00000                 00000  
             00010                 00011
             Islands: 2            Islands: 2

Output: [1, 1, 2, 2]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 4, m = 5, k = 4
Operations: [[0,0], [1,1], [2,2], [3,3]]

Each operation creates a separate island.
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
