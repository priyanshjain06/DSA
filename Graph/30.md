# 🚀 Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a **Directed Acyclic Graph** of `V` vertices from `0` to `n-1` and a **2D Integer array** `edges[][]` of length `E`, where there is a directed edge from `edge[i][0]` to `edge[i][1]` with a distance of `edge[i][2]` for all `i`.

**Find the shortest path from `src(0)` vertex to all the vertices** and if it is impossible to reach any vertex, then return `-1` for that vertex.

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
V = 4, E = 2
edges = [[0,1,2], [0,2,1]]
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 2, 1, -1]
```

**Explanation:**

- Shortest path from `0` to `1` is `0→1` with edge weight `2`
- Shortest path from `0` to `2` is `0→2` with edge weight `1`
- There is no way we can reach `3`, so it's `-1` for `3`

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
V = 6, E = 7
edges = [[0,1,2], [0,4,1], [4,5,4], [4,2,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,6], [5,3,1]]
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5]
```

**Explanation:**

- Shortest path from `0` to `1` is `0→1` with edge weight `2`
- Shortest path from `0` to `2` is `0→4→2` with edge weight `1+2=3`
- Shortest path from `0` to `3` is `0→4→5→3` with edge weight `1+4+1=6`
- Shortest path from `0` to `4` is `0→4` with edge weight `1`
- Shortest path from `0` to `5` is `0→4→5` with edge weight `1+4=5`
