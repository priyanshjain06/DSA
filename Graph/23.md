Problem Statement (Refined)
You are given N tasks labeled from 0 to N-1, and some tasks have prerequisites. A prerequisite pair [a, b] means task 'a' depends on task 'b' (i.e., 'b' must be completed before 'a').

Your task is to determine whether all N tasks can be completed. If a cycle exists in the dependency graph, it is impossible to complete all tasks.

Example 1
Input:
N = 4, P = 3  
prerequisites = [[1,0], [2,1], [3,2]]
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
Task completion order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 (No cycle)

Example 2
Input:
N = 2, P = 2  
prerequisites = [[1,0], [0,1]]
Output:
No
Explanation:
Cycle exists: 0 → 1 → 0 (Deadlock)

It is impossible to complete all tasks.
