    # 🌐 Shortest Path in Weighted Undirected Graph

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given an **undirected, weighted graph** with **V** vertices numbered from `0` to `V-1` and **E** edges, represented by 2D array **`edges[][]`**, where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` represents the **edge** between the nodes `u` and `v` having `w` **edge weight**.

You have to find the **shortest distance** of all the vertices from the source vertex **`src`**, and return an array of integers where the **ith** element denotes the shortest distance between **ith** node and source vertex **`src`**.

> **Note:** The Graph is connected and doesn't contain any negative weight edge.

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
V = 3
edges[][] = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6]]
src = 2
```

**Output:**

```
[4, 3, 0]
```

**📍 Explanation:**

**Shortest Paths:**

- For `2` to `0` minimum distance will be `4`. By following path `2 → 1 → 0`
- For `2` to `1` minimum distance will be `3`. By following path `2 → 1`
- For `2` to `2` minimum distance will be `0`. By following path `2 → 2`

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
V = 5
edges[][] = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 8], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 10]]
src = 0
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 4, 8, 10, 10]
```

**📍 Explanation:**

**Shortest Paths:**

- For `0` to `1` minimum distance will be `4`. By following path `0 → 1`
- For `0` to `2` minimum distance will be `8`. By following path `0 → 2`
- For `0` to `3` minimum distance will be `10`. By following path `0 → 2 → 3`
- For `0` to `4` minimum distance will be `10`. By following path `0 → 1 → 4`
