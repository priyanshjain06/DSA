# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Problem

## Problem Statement

Given a weighted graph with **V** vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and **E** edges, represented by a 2D array **edges[][]**, where **edges[i] = [u, v, w]** represents a direct edge from node **u** to **v** having **w** edge weight. You are also given a source vertex **src**.

Your task is to compute the **shortest distances** from the **source** to all other vertices. If a vertex is unreachable from the source, its distance should be marked as **10⁸**. Additionally, if the graph contains a **negative weight cycle**, return **[-1]** to indicate that shortest paths cannot be reliably computed.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
V = 5
edges[][] = [[1, 3, 2], [4, 3, -1], [2, 4, 1], [1, 2, 1], [0, 1, 5]]
src = 0
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 5, 6, 6, 7]
```

**Explanation:**

```
Shortest Paths:
• For 0 to 1: minimum distance = 5
  Path: 0 → 1

• For 0 to 2: minimum distance = 6
  Path: 0 → 1 → 2

• For 0 to 3: minimum distance = 6
  Path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3

• For 0 to 4: minimum distance = 7
  Path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 4
```

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
V = 4
edges[][] = [[0, 1, 4], [1, 2, -6], [2, 3, 5], [3, 1, -2]]
src = 0
```

**Output:**

```
[-1]
```

**Explanation:**

```
The graph contains a negative weight cycle formed by the path 1 → 2 → 3 → 1,
where the total weight of the cycle is negative.
```
