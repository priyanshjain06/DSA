# Find Eventual Safe States (Leetcode 802)

## Problem Statement

Given a directed graph with `n` nodes (0 to `n-1`), where `graph[i]` represents edges from node `i`, find all safe nodes. A node is safe if every possible path from it leads to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges) or another safe node.

Return the list of safe nodes sorted in ascending order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```cpp
graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output:

[2,4,5,6]
Explanation:

Terminal Nodes: 5, 6 (no outgoing edges).

Safe Nodes: 2, 4, 5, 6 (all paths from these lead to terminal nodes).

Example 2
Input:

graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output:
[4]
Explanation:

Terminal Node: 4 (no outgoing edges).

Safe Node: 4 (all paths from 4 lead to 4).

```
