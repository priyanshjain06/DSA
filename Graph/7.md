Problem Statement:
You are given an n Ã— n adjacency matrix isConnected, where isConnected[i][j] = 1 means city i and city j are directly connected, and 0 means they are not.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities.

Return the number of provinces.

Example 1:
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
