# Topological Sort for a DAG

## Problem Statement
Given an adjacency list for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where `adj[u]` contains all vertices `v` such that there exists a directed edge `u -> v`. Return topological sort for the given graph.

Topological sorting for a DAG is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.
Return 1 if the returned topological sort is correct, otherwise 0.

## Examples

**Input:**
```cpp
adj = [[], [0], [0], [0]]
Output:
1
Explanation: Few valid topological orders: [3, 2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0]

Input:
adj = [[], [3], [3], [], [0,1], [0,2]]
Output:
1
Explanation: Few valid topological orders: [4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3]
