// NOTE You are given a matrix M of size n x n where:

// M[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j.
// M[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j.
// You need to find if there is a celebrity in the party, and return the celebrityâ€™s index. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

// use nested loops and check for each element using an array and ignoring the diagonal elements
