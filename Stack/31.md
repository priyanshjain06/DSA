# StockSpanner Algorithm

## Problem Statement

Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the **span** of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the **maximum number of consecutive days** (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was **less than or equal** to the price of that day.

### Example Explanation

- If the prices of the stock in the last four days are `[7, 2, 1, 2]` and the price of the stock today is `2`, then the span of today is **4** because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal to `2` for **4 consecutive days**.
- If the prices of the stock in the last four days are `[7, 34, 1, 2]` and the price of the stock today is `8`, then the span of today is **3** because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal to `8` for **3 consecutive days**.

### Implementation Requirements

Implement the `StockSpanner` class:

- `StockSpanner()` initializes the object of the class.
- `int next(int price)` returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

## Example Usage

### Input:

```plaintext
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
```

### Output:
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
Explanation:
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // returns 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // returns 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // returns 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // returns 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // returns 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // returns 4
stockSpanner.next(85);  // returns 6
```
