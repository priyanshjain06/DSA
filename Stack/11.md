# Nearest Smaller Element Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array, find the nearest smaller element `G[i]` for every element `A[i]` in the array such that the element has an index smaller than `i`.

## Formal Definition

`G[i]` for an element `A[i]` = an element `A[j]` such that:

- `j` is maximum possible **AND**
- `j < i` **AND**
- `A[j] < A[i]`

Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as `-1`.

## Input Format

The only argument given is integer array `A`.

## Output Format

Return the integer array `G` such that `G[i]` contains nearest smaller number than `A[i]`. If no such element occurs `G[i]` should be `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
A = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
```

**Output:**

```
G = [-1, 4, -1, 2, 2]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Index 0:** No element less than 4 in left of 4, `G[0] = -1`
- **Index 1:** `A[0]` is only element less than `A[1]`, `G[1] = A[0] = 4`
- **Index 2:** No element less than 2 in left of 2, `G[2] = -1`
- **Index 3:** `A[2]` is nearest element which is less than `A[3]`, `G[3] = A[2] = 2`
- **Index 4:** `A[2]` is nearest element which is less than `A[4]`, `G[4] = A[2] = 2`

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
A = [3, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

```
G = [-1, -1, -1]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Index 0:** No element less than 3 in left of 3, `G[0] = -1`
- **Index 1:** No element less than 2 in left of 2, `G[1] = -1`
- **Index 2:** No element less than 1 in left of 1, `G[2] = -1`
