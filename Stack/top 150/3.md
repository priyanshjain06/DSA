# Basic Calculator - String Expression Evaluator

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it and return the result of the evaluation.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

## Algorithm: Stack-Based Approach

### Key Concepts
- Use stack to handle parentheses and operator precedence
- Process expression character by character
- Handle spaces, numbers, operastors, and parentheses

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Track current number** being built
2. **Track current operator** ('+' or '-')
3. **Use stack** to handle parentheses
4. **When encountering '('** - push current result and operator to stack
5. **When encountering ')'** - pop from stack and combine results
