Given an array arr[] containing positive elements, the task is to find the length of the longest subarray of an input array containing at most two distinct integers.

Examples:

Input: arr[]= [2, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The entire array [2, 1, 2] contains at most two distinct integers (2 and 1). Hence, the length of the longest subarray is 3.
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subarray containing at most two distinct integers is [1, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has a length of 5. The subarray starts at the second element 1 and ends at the last element. It contains at most two distinct integers (1 and 2).
