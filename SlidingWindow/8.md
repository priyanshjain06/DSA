Given an integer k and a string s, any character in the string can be selected and changed to any other uppercase English character. This operation can be performed up to k times. After completing these steps, return the length of the longest substring that contains the same letter.

Examples:
Input : s = "BAABAABBBAAA" , k = 2
Output : 6

Explanation : we can change the B present at index 0 , 3 (0 base indexing) to A.
The new string is "AAAAAABBBAAA".
The substring "AAAAAA" is the longest substring having same letter with length 6.



Input : s = "AABABBA" , k = 1
Output : 4

Explanation : The underlined characters are changed in the new string obtained.
The new string is "AABBBBA". The substring "BBBB" is the answer.
