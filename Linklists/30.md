Given a doubly linked list of n nodes sorted by values, the task is to remove duplicate nodes present in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
1<->1<->1<->2<->3<->4
Output:
1<->2<->3<->4
Explanation:
Only the first occurance of node with value 1 is
retained, rest nodes with value = 1 are deleted.
