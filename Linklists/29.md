Given a sorted doubly linked list of positive distinct elements, the task is to find pairs in a doubly-linked list whose sum is equal to given value target.

Example 1:

Input:  
1 <-> 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 8 <-> 9
target = 7
Output: (1, 6), (2,5)
Explanation: We can see that there are two pairs 
(1, 6) and (2,5) with sum 7.
