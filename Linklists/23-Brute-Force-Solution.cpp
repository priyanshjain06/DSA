//NOTE - Problem Statement: Given a linked list of integers. Segregate all even numbers and odd numbers in the linked list. 
//Such that odd are placed first and the even numbers are placed after them  without changing the sequecne of nodes.

//ANCHOR -  Time Complexity is : O(n) and space Complexity is O(n)

//LINK we will store all the odd nodes first and then even nodes into an array by traversing the given linklist and then we will traverse the array and insert the nodes in the linklist 

//TODO -  See the screenshot for solution you will understand the code !
