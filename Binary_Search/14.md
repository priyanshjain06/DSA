# 🔍 Find Peak Element

**A peak element** is an element that is **strictly greater** than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index of **any one of them**.

> **Edge Case Assumption:*
> *  
> `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`  
> *(Elements outside the array are considered `-∞` for comparison.)*

**🎯 Goal:** Write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.

## 📝 **Examples**

### **Example 1**
**Input:**  
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
