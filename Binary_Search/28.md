# Row with Maximum Ones

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D binary array `arr[][]` consisting of only `1`s and `0`s. Each row of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find and return the index of the first row that contains the maximum number of `1`s. If no such row exists, return `-1`.

**Note:**

- The array follows 0-based indexing.
- The number of rows and columns in the array are denoted by `n` and `m` respectively.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr[][] = [[0,1,1,1], [0,0,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [0,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Row 2 contains the most number of 1s (4 1s). Hence, the output is 2.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr[][] = [[0,0], [1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Row 1 contains the most number of 1s (2 1s). Hence, the output is 1.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: arr[][] = [[0,0], [0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No row contains any 1s, so the output is -1.
```
