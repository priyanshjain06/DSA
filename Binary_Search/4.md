Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than the target, the lower bound will be the length of the array

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[] where element (arr[3] = 10) is greater than or equal to 9.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the smallest index in arr[] where element (arr[4] = 11) is greater than or equal to 11.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100
Output: 7
Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater than 100, return the length of array.
