# Search a 2D Matrix

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

**Time Complexity**: O(log(m \* n))  
**Space Complexity**: O(1)
