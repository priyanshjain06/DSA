Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' having 'n' distinct integers sorted in ascending order. The array is right rotated 'r' times

Find the minimum value of 'r'.

Right rotating an array means shifting the element at 'ith' index to (‘i+1') mod 'n' index, for all 'i' from 0 to ‘n-1'.

Example:
Input: 'n' = 5 , ‘arr’ = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
If we rotate the array [1 ,2, 3, 4, 5] right '3' times then we will get the 'arr'. Thus 'r' = 3.

Sample Input 1:
4
2 3 4 1

Sample Output 1:
3

Explanation of sample output 1:
If we right rotate the array {1, 2, 3, 4} by '3' times then we will get {2, 3, 4, 1}. Thus 'r' = 3.

Sample Input 2:
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 2:
0

Explanation of sample output 2:
If we right rotate the array {1, 2, 3} by '0' time then we will get {1, 2, 3}. Thus 'r' = 0.
