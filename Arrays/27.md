Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers. Find the elements that appear more than N/3 times in the array. If no such element exists, return an empty vector.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format
: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,2,3,2}
Result
: 2
Explanation:
Here we can see that the Count(1) = 1, Count(2) = 3 and Count(3) = 1.Therefore, the count of 2 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 2 is the answer.

Example 2:
Input Format
: N = 6, array[] = {11,33,33,11,33,11}
Result:
11 33
Explanation:
Here we can see that the Count(11) = 3 and Count(33) = 3. Therefore, the count of both 11 and 33 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 11 and 33 is the answer.
