A permutation of an array is a rearrangement of its elements. For example, [1,2,3] has permutations [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array is the next lexicographically greater arrangement. If no greater arrangement exists, it is rearranged to the smallest possible order.

Example:
nums = [1,2,3] → [1,3,2]
nums = [2,3,1] → [3,1,2]
nums = [3,2,1] → [1,2,3]
