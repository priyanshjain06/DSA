## Solution Patterns

### Problem 121 Pattern
```
Track: min_price, max_profit
For each price:
  - Update min_price if current < min_price
  - Update max_profit if (current - min_price) > max_profit
```

### Problem 122 Pattern
```
Track: total_profit
For each consecutive pair:
  - If price[i+1] > price[i]: add difference to profit
  - This captures all upward movements
```
