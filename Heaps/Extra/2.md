You are given an array arr of N integers representing a min Heap. The task is to convert it to max Heap.

A max-heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.

Input:
N = 4
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output:
[4, 2, 3, 1]
Explanation:

The given min Heap:

          1
        /   \
      2       3
     /

4

Max Heap after conversion:

         4
       /   \
      2     3
    /

1

Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
arr = [3, 4, 8, 11, 13]
Output:
[13, 11, 8, 3, 4]
Explanation:

The given min Heap:

          3
        /   \
      4      8
    /   \

11 13

Max Heap after conversion:

          13
        /    \
      11      8
    /   \

3 4
