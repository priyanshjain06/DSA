Given a binary heap implementation of Priority Queue. Extract the maximum element from the queue i.e. remove it from the Queue and return it's value.

Examples :

Input: 4 2 8 16 24 2 6 5
Output: 24
Priority Queue after extracting maximum: 16 8 6 5 2 2 4
Input: 64 12 8 48 5
Output: 64
Priority Queue after extracting maximum: 48 12 8 5

//NOTE ALGO :
Remove the root (the maximum element).
Replace the root with the last element in the heap (the rightmost leaf).
Reheapify the heap: Adjust the heap so that the max-heap property is maintained (i.e., the new root and its descendants should satisfy the heap property).
