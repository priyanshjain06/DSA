Problem Statement: Given a binary tree, Find the Lowest Common Ancestor for two given Nodes (x,y).

Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA): The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes x and y as the lowest node in T that has both x and y as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself.)
