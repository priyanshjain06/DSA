Check for Children Sum Property in a Binary Tree
Problem Statement: Given a Binary Tree, convert the value of its nodes to follow the Children Sum Property. The Children Sum Property in a binary tree states that for every node, the sum of its children's values (if they exist) should be equal to the node's value. If a child is missing, it is considered as having a value of 0.

Note:

The node values can be increased by any positive integer any number of times, but decrementing any node value is not allowed.
A value for a NULL node can be assumed as 0.
We cannot change the structure of the given binary tree.
