# Reverse Words in String

## Problem Statement

You are given a string 'STR' containing space-separated words. A word is a sequence of non-space characters. Your task is to reverse the order of words in 'STR'.

Note: Try to do it in-place without allocating extra space.

## Example

```
'STR' = "when in doubt use brute force"
The reverse order of words in 'STR' is: "force brute use doubt in when".
```

## Note

1. 'STR' does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
2. The words are always separated by a single whitespace character.

## Constraints

```
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Length of 'STR' <= 10^3
The string 'STR' contains only 'a-z' and whitespace characters.

Time limit: 1 second
```
