     Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an
     anagram
     of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false

//REVIEW anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example:

"listen" can be rearranged to form "silent."
"evil" can be rearranged to form "vile."
In other words, two strings (or words) are anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.
