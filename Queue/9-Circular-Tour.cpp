// NOTE You are given two arrays petrol[] and distance[], where each index i represents a petrol pump:

// petrol[i] represents the amount of petrol available at the i - th petrol pump.distance[i] represents the distance from the i - th petrol pump to the next.Your task is to find the starting petrol pump index from which a truck can start its journey around a circular route and return to the same petrol pump, without the truck running out of petrol.The truck consumes 1 unit of petrol per unit of distance traveled.

// If it's possible to complete the circular route, return the starting petrol pump index. If itâ€™s not possible, return -1.
