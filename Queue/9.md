# Gas Station Problem

## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `petrol[]` and `distance[]`, where each index `i` represents a petrol pump:

- `petrol[i]` represents the amount of petrol available at the i-th petrol pump
- `distance[i]` represents the distance from the i-th petrol pump to the next

Your task is to find the starting petrol pump index from which a truck can start its journey around a circular route and return to the same petrol pump, without the truck running out of petrol.

**Key Points:**
- The truck consumes 1 unit of petrol per unit of distance traveled
- If it's possible to complete the circular route, return the starting petrol pump index
- If it's not possible, return -1

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
- Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
- Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
- Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
- Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
- Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.

Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

### Example 2:
```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
```

**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
- Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
- Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
- You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.

Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
