Problem Statement: Given two arrays representing childrenâ€™s green factor and cookie sizes, the goal is to maximise the number of content children.

Each child i has a greed factor of g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that will make the child content. Each cookie j has a size of s[j]. If s[j] >= g[j], we can assign cookie j to child i, making the child content. Each child can only receive one cookie.
