# Reverse Bits Problem

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Note:
* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 11
Output: 13
Explanation:
(11)10 = (1011)2.
After reversing the bits we get:
(1101)2 = (13)10.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N = 10
Output: 5
Explanation:
(10)10 = (1010)2.
After reversing the bits we get:
(0101)2 = (101)2 = (5)10.
```
