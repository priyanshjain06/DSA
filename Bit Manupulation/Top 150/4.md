# Bitwise OR of Numbers Range

Given 2 integers L, R as input, and find the **bitwise OR** of all the integers in the range [L, R] (both inclusive).

## Example 1:
```
Input: L = 3, R = 8
Output: 15
Explanation: 3|4|5|6|7|8 = 15 
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: L = 12, R = 18
Output: 31
Explanation: 12|13|14|15|16|17|18 = 31
```

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **findBitwiseOR()** which takes the **L** and **R** as inputs and returns the answer.

## Expected Time Complexity: 
O(log R)

## Expected Auxiliary Space: 
O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^12F
